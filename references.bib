    abstract = "Life expectancy at birth is considered a parameter of the social development,health system, or economic development of a country. We aimed to investigate theeffects of GDP per capita (as the economic factor), health care expenditure, thenumber of medical doctors (as social factors), and CO(2) emissions (as theenvironmental factor) on life expectancy. We used panel data analysis for 13Eastern European countries over the 2000-2020 period. After performing theanalysis, we used a cross-country fixed-effects panel (GLS with SUR weights).According to our model, a one percent increase in health expenditure (as \% ofGDP) increases life expectancy at birth by 0.376 years, whereas each additionalmedical doctor per 10,000 inhabitants increases life expectancy at birth by 0.088years on average. At the same time, each additional 10,000 USD per capita eachyear would increase life expectancy at birth by 1.8 years on average. If CO(2)emissions increase by 1 metric ton per capita, life expectancy at birth woulddecrease by 0.24 years, suggesting that higher carbon emissions are capable ofreducing longevity. Every European country has to make special efforts toincrease the life expectancy of its inhabitants by applying economic and healthpolicies focused on the well-being of the population.",
